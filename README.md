# DCustom - Sinatra Template

Landing on the land of Ruby 2 years ago was the best change that has ever
happened to me in my software engineering career. I love the language, its
simplicity, and the two beautiful web frameworks it has - Ruby on Rails and
Sinatra.

**DCustom** is a Sinatra template that I am working on to start a new project
of mine. The work on the template and the project is getting interrupted
because of my busy schedule at oDesk, but I think I will invest more time on
this in the future.

**Warning** - Under Construction, but features are kinda working...

## Features

The intention of the project is to be able to kick off a multi-lingual site 
quickly as possible.

- Sinatra
- RVM (needs to update to Ruby 2.1.5)
- Datamapper
- Slim
- Sass
- CoffeeScript
- bower for asset management
- i18n for translations

## Features awaiting

There is a lot to implement, here are some of the features I am hoping to 
implement. Some of them seem too much to integrate to a starter template. 

- Coming soon template with a counter (I think this is too much)
- Require JS
- View Framework (Angular is cool, but thinking of some thing simpler)


## Tests

The version doesn't use RSpec yet, but it soon will. Cucumber is is setup
for acceptance testing.

## Thanks

A big thanks goes for Bjoern, the CTO of Clothes Network, the guys who keep me
busy most of the time. I owe him my Sinatra knowledge and the structure of
the project and the stack would have close resemblance to what he him self uses.
